            Unfolding Order in Cosmopolitan Progress
        </h1>
        <p>
            In Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose, Kant argues that the apparent purposiveness in the parts of nature reflect its true hidden purpose as a whole (Kant, 48). By directing humanity through their unsocial sociability and conflict, nature propels humanity toward moral and rational progress (Kant, 44). What more, the human capacity for improvement–also known as Rousseau’s concept of perfectibility–allows the fulfillment of that progress as humanity’s imperfections can only be remedied through that perfectibility (Rousseau, 72). As such, these parts in the order of nature work in tandem to realize the hidden purposiveness and end goal of nature–a cosmopolitan order—a vision that both critiques and transcends Rousseau's preference for the state of nature by affirming the necessity of societal development for achieving true freedom and morality.

            Kant discusses how nature appears to operate according to certain processes, which indicate a purpose in the fostering of the progress of humanity. However, he also acknowledges the difficulty in proving such a claim and does concede to the fact that there is a retrospective aspect to obtaining such a revelation. He first explains this by stating that “the history of the human race as a whole can be regarded as the realization of a hidden plan of nature to bring about an internally–and for this purpose also externally–perfect political constitution in which all natural capacities of mankind can be developed completely,” (Kant, 50). Human history is disjointed, considering how its parts–which can be understood as epochs–are differentiated by arbitrary markers. However, the purpose behind the separation of history is to facilitate the comprehensibility of a massive time period; to understand small portions at a time in order to then piece together the whole. The same goes for nature and its intentions, which Kant has just declared to be tied to human history. He frames nature as having a hidden purpose that has been unfolding throughout the existence of humanity, urging us towards a ‘perfect political constitution’ in which we will be able to achieve perfection (Kant, 50). Kant then goes on to describe “the greatest problem for the human species, the solution of which nature compels him to seek, is that of attaining a civil society which can administer justice universally,” (Kant, 45). Here he reveals the telos of nature to be the creation of that civil society. Nature’s purposiveness in its parts–in pushing humanity to explore systems of justice and order to attain societal progress–exists to achieve a society in which the ideal version of man can be realized, thus exposing the purposiveness in the order of nature as a whole.

            In order to achieve the progress that will result in the realization of nature’s telos, Kant asserts that nature wields the imperfection of humanity in order to drive that progress. Ultimately, nature is described to utilize the competitive aspect of human nature to spur their perfectibility (Rousseau, 72). He details how “the means which nature employs to bring about the development of innate capacities is that of antagonism in society, in so far as this antagonism becomes in the long run the cause of law-governed social order,” (Kant, 44). Man has individual motivations that derive from his selfishness, yet also a desire to live within a society (Kant, 44). Within these clashing motivations lies Kant’s definition of unsocial sociability, which describes the manner by which the man’s selfish inclinations lead to conflict within society (Kant, 44). As such, the conflict and competition that are rooted in the unsocial sociability of the nature of man spurs humanity to create laws and organized societies. Kant further explains the driving factors behind progress when stating that “the resultant evils [of war] still have a beneficial effect. For they compel our species to discover a law of equilibrium to regulate the essentially healthy hostility which prevails among the states,” (Kant, 49). Where man desires peace, nature sows the seeds of discord (Kant, 45). Though such a concept sounds negative, Kant’s word choices of ‘healthy’ and ‘beneficial’ when describing ‘hostility’ and ‘evils,’ transform the morality of the subject. Nature requires and fosters that innate self-interest and competitiveness to achieve its end goal of a perfect political constitution (Kant, 50). As such, the flaws of humanity serve to aid a greater purpose, as Kant declares that conflict and violence are necessary to progress towards the final objective of nature.

            In his inquiry into the purposiveness of nature, Kant acknowledges Rousseau’s judgement of society, yet remains unswayed by Rousseau’s preference for the state of nature as it lacks the conditions Kant believes are necessary for progress. His conclusion that nature is systematic and goal-directed, with humanity’s moral development as its end, critiques the primitive state of nature; outside of society man is incapable of fully developing his natural capacities and thus fulfilling his purpose as well (Kant, 42). Moreover, according to his teleological theory, if animals do not have or achieve their purpose, nature turns to “an aimless, random process, and the dismal reign of chance replaces the guiding principle of reason,” (Kant, 42). Here, Kant outright rejects Rousseau’s preference by emphasizing the necessity for progress through his depiction of the ‘dismal’ state of nature without it. He argues that nature’s purpose requires advancement, and that a static existence contradicts his theory concerning the ends of nature. However, Kant still recognizes that society poses challenges, stating that “as long as states apply all their resources to vain and violent schemes of expansion, thus incessantly obstructing the slow and laborious efforts of the citizens to cultivate their minds…no progress in this direction can be expected,” (Kant, 49). He previously underscored the importance of conflict in achieving the final purposes of nature, yet now admits that an overabundance of the negative products of man’s unsocial sociability can result in stagnation. The chaos of political relations deprives humanity of a proper environment in which men can learn and progress, which could result in the same ‘dismal’ state Kant mentioned concerning a lack of society (Kant, 42). Under such conditions, he may believe that Rousseau’s preference for the state of nature may be warranted, considering how both environments contradict his teleological theory, but nature lacks the evils of war.

            After supporting his claim of the hidden purposiveness of nature, Kant goes on to assert the connection between his cosmopolitan order and the morality and freedom of humanity. In order to achieve its telos, nature wields the flaws of mankind to drive them towards improvement (Kant, 44). Upon deeper examination, the advancements of humanity involve the exploration of justice in political society, as man seeks calm and security within the chaos of conflict (Kant, 48). What more, Kant views history as moving toward a unified, peaceful global order where human reason flourishes, and declares that “the highest task which nature has set for mankind must therefore be that of establishing a society in which freedom under external laws would be combined with irresistible force, in other words of establishing a perfectly just civil constitution,” (Kant, 46, 50). His emphasis on justice indicates the necessity for human morality in nature’s telos, and thus reveals the role of morality as a part of nature’s hidden purposiveness. The antagonism and resulting conflicts of humanity contain evils that work towards man’s education concerning justice, as well as the continuous development and improvement of political institutions. Moreover, the perfect civil society allows for freedom under the laws, meaning that “this state of affairs is not completely free from danger…but it is also not without a principle of equality,” (Kant, 49). Kant does not believe that nature’s telos depicts a utopian society, but rather, one in which the presence of equality permits freedom. He doesn’t define freedom in the same manner as–for example–Rousseau, who believes that man in the state of nature is not bound by government nor thought (Rousseau, 72). Instead, he ties the concept of freedom to equality and justice–parts of nature’s telos–meaning that Kant’s understanding of freedom is the ability to be equal under the law. Thus, the culmination of nature’s purpose for humanity lies in the gradual realization of freedom and morality, governed by just laws to achieve a cosmopolitan political society.

        In the Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose, Kant reveals his vision of humanity and the role of nature. He first questions the purposiveness of nature while asserting that of its parts, and goes on to conduct a careful exploration of humanity, and their inherent antagonism, conflict, perfectibility, and morality. Each represents parts in the order of nature that possess purpose, which result in the guidance of mankind towards moral and societal development (Kant, 44). What more, Kant views them through the lens of history and evolution, in order to gain a retrospective view of a possible end goal towards which nature has been driving humanity. His examination of human history allows for the understanding of progress, and how it is rooted in the advancements of justice, morality, polity, and the fulfillment of man’s innate capabilities. As such, he demonstrates the teleological aspect of nature’s purpose, which ends in the creation of a rational, cosmopolitan order (Kant, 46). Thus, through Kant’s analysis of the order of nature, he proves that nature is purposive as a whole when viewed through its parts.
