            Self-Worth in the Multiverse
        </h1>

            I believe in the multiverse–not the superhero-filled kind of Marvel and DC, but the type explored in Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s Everything Everywhere All At Once. Each new decision creates a universe branching off from the original, and when considering all these versions of myself existing, perhaps thriving, in parallel universes, I wonder how I compare.

            The film’s protagonist, Evelyn Wang, is the worst version of herself. Her existence is the culmination of her terrible decisions over the years. Knowing that a worst version of myself–a worst Sarene–could exist, I end up questioning where I fall in the hierarchy of the multiverse. What truly defines a “better” self? Since each universe branches off at each new decision, I find that the best version of myself must be the most confident in each decision she makes. Upon reflection, I discovered three of the most important decisions I have made: starting to read at age four, continuing to sail at age nine, and learning how to assert myself at age fifteen.

            At age four, I was entering kindergarten, which starts earlier in England, so my mother attempted to teach me how to read before school began. She was met, however, with fierce resistance, as I believed myself content in a world where words were given to me, a world in which I lacked autonomy. I was a month shy of five when I approached my mother with books piled high in my arms, obscuring my face, and four words–I want to read. I went through all twenty books in one sitting. Choosing to learn to read set the tone for my academic pursuits; whenever I’m excited by a subject, I tear through every available resource.

            The summer after I turned nine, I decided to continue sailing after a terrible first week. The first day, the boom smacked me in the head with all the force of the wind. The next, I navigated a racecourse with a throbbing head and no clue how to race. After a week of hideous bruises, I returned home wet, bedraggled, and dispirited. However, I rallied and returned for a second week; within a fortnight, I was the best racer my age. My choice to persevere echoes through how I face challenges today. I struggled with writing in English class, despite being a voracious reader. After years of meetings with teachers and honing my writing skills, I tested into the advanced 400-level English class for senior year.

            I was fifteen when I realized that I needed to be more assertive. A place I found myself actually being bold was Model UN, so I began to treat everyday life like a MUN conference. I set quotas for myself to speak in each class at least once a day, and to someone new each week. Leaving my comfort zone grated, yet within a month I saw progress. My new attitude was tested at the next MUN conference, and I won an Outstanding Delegate Award. The best part of my self-imposed learning cycle is that it never ended; I continue to test my social limits and become more self-assured.

            I have strived all my life to improve myself and ensure I am confident in my choices, but I wonder, does any of that matter when there exist infinite universes and thus infinite “Sarenes?” The antagonist of Everything Everywhere All at Once, Jobu Tupaki, was not dangerous due to her reality-bending power, but because of her belief that everything is meaningless since the multiverse is infinite. I disagree, because no matter how many times each action I take may be echoed in endless universes, I know that the version of myself in this universe is still worthwhile. I am confident in each decision I make, because I know that the defining quality that ties all the “Sarenes’’ together is resilience, and, unlike Jobu Tupaki, I will never give up.
