            My Ten Commandments
        </h1>

        Billy Wilder, the director and screenwriter of films like Some Like It Hot and Sunset Boulevard, once said “I have ten commandments. The first nine are, thou shalt not bore. The tenth is, thou shalt have the right of final cut.” What are your ten commandments and why did you choose them?

            If Billy Wilder’s commandments establish the rules of his identity as a director, then mine establish the rules of my identity as a sailor. My ten commandments guide not just my deportment on a boat, but also in life.

            I was nine when I conquered my fear of sailing. That year, one humid July day, my friends Axel, Charlie, and I had reached the farthest point in our sail in the Long Island Sound, when, suddenly, ozone filled our noses and dark clouds began to devour the sky. The torrential downpour and tempestuous waves left us shivering and queasy. Our noses burned, our eyes ran, and with lightning imminent, danger mounted. We were in a race against the storm. I expected fear to freeze my heart, yet I was so focused on returning safely, I had no room for despair. Though I knew the low visibility and high winds posed challenges, my instincts took over. The boat became an extension of my body. My crew and I communicated through body language, as the howling wind swallowed our words. With each lurch, I laughed with unbridled glee. Exhilaration replaced terror and my heartbeat matched the kamikaze waves. I would return to sail each day, each year, in the hopes that the ferocious ocean gods would possess me once again.

            When sailing, especially in the aforementioned heavy winds, it is crucial to maintain presence of mind. Accordingly, my first nine commandments are: “thou shalt watch thy head.” The wind can knock the boom into a sailor’s head at any time, and even five knots can leave a sizable bruise. So, thou needst to watch thy head. Also, my parents said that I am not allowed to get another concussion. However, watching your head extends beyond the literal meaning, as one needs to be aware of other boats, the wind, sails, and crew, in order to stay upright. When I advanced from racer to counselor, I swapped optimizing speed while watching my own head for watching the heads of campers. The water became the enemy. A single splash on a camper was DEFCON 1. I found a balance between being the kids’s friend and their drill sergeant by nudging them out of their comfort zone. I let my arm get hit instead of their heads while they focused on steering. In the end, if I see savage delight in their eyes with each choppy wave, I know they will have conquered the beginner’s anxiety. I hope at that point that they can watch their own heads, but I am happy to do so until then.

            My tenth commandment is “thou shalt capsize with glee.” No matter how vigilant a sailor you are, you will get knocked over at some point. Accept it. Revel in the moment, the inevitability of it. A capsize is the moment where you give in to the wind and the sea, and let loose. The thrill right before you fall off the boat, of seeing the sail vanish underwater, is the indisputable best part of sailing. Moreover, I believe that finding amusement in any moment of defeat is crucial, for humor is the antithesis of fear. If I lived life terrified by the prospect of failure, I would never venture out of my comfort zone and I would grow dull.

            My first nine commandments dictate to watch thy head–to be aware, as a sailor must always do. My tenth, however, accepts the countermanding, inescapable truth that just because you do everything “right,” things can still go wrong. I often struggle with a need for control but, while sailing, whether I capsize or not is up to the caprices of the wind. I am forced to surrender control in the face of the unpredictable. My ten commandments speak to how I love sailing not just for the adventure, but for the framework it provides for how I live.
